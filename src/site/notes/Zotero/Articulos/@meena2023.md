>Detecting weeds, diseases, and pests in the agricultural field is a crucial concern for farmers. Weeds compete for light, nutrients, water, space and crop damage is caused by pests such as insects, mice, and birds and crop diseases pose a significant risk to food security. Farmers have relied on traditional methods to boost yield production in the past. The advancement of deep learning approaches helps to classify various types of photos in practice. For plant leaf disease detection, pest detection, and weed detection, we acquired many images of plant disease pairs, pest and weed images from varied crops. The data augmentation process is carried out because Deep Learning works effectively with larger data sets. The neural model was created using multiple types of DCNN architecture, and the models were interpreted based on their accuracy and performance. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters and layers of the DenseNet201, Mobilenet, VGG16, Hyperparameter Search and InceptionV3 on agricultural image data. The fine-tuned InceptionV3 model outperformed by 87.85% when comparing the final value. Mobilenet and VGG16, on the other hand, achieved accuracy of 91.85% and 78.71% respectively, DenseNet model performs well with 99.62% accuracy whereas the Hyperparameter Search with 71.07% accuracy. The model's effective performance in weed,plant disease and pest disease classification is described by the produced resultant value.
