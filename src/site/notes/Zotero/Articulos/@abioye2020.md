> [!abstract]+ 
>The communication between aerial and ground is beginning to have enormous beneﬁts in Agriculture by modernising the ways in which farmers work. The application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is therefore becoming widely accepted as it is beginning to have a huge impact on food sustainability and security. The aim of this paper is to present an on-going research on the use of aerial robotic systems for practising sustainable precision agriculture by small and medium scale maize, rice, and sugar cane plantation farmers in the West African savannah. The objective is to design and develop practical UAV-based solutions that would enable the adoption of the precision agriculture farming technique by these farmers. The proposed method involved the development of a 450 mm quad-rotor UAV platform with RGB sensor for capturing high-resolution RGB image data, to be analysed using a combination of computer vision, machine learning, and photogrammetric techniques, to extract useful information for appropriate application of the precision agriculture techniques. From the image data analysis, farmers would be able to monitor crop health, pest invasion, detect weed, crop diseases, monitor farm irrigation requirement, crop growth, and estimate crop yield. The overall intention is to develop sustainable methods in farming that would increase the crop yield, minimise the use of chemicals while optimising both production and proﬁt based on real time information.
