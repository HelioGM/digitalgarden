> [!abstract]+ 
>As field sampling is time consuming, it is necessary to develop efficient sampling techniques to obtain accurate estimates of the weed seedbank in soil. The relative efficiency between sampling schemes depends on the spatial variability in weed seed density across agricultural fields. Spatial variability of the weed seed density was characterized by theoretical correlograms. A systematic sampling (square grill) scheme was considered and it was found that, taking into account spatial variability, this sampling scheme was more efficient than simple random sampling. As a result, the sample size can be reduced in comparison with that given in previous studies, where spatial correlation was ignored. The reduction depends on the correlation structure defined as a function of the ratio, Ï„, between the nugget effect and the sill of the variogram. The maximum reduction of the sample size, without loss of either precision or confidence level corresponds to the case where there is no nugget effect, Ï„ = 0. The opposite extreme case, where the reduction is nil, corresponds to the case of a pure nugget effect Ï„ = 1. The abaci based on given expressions are provided to determine the sample size in species whose spatial pattern can be fitted either to a Poisson or to a negative binomial distribution.

## Notes

@ambrosio2004

gpt:: Â Este estudio evalÃºa diferentes mÃ©todos de muestreo y determina el tamaÃ±o de muestra adecuado para estimar el banco de semillas de malezas en el suelo, considerando la variabilidad espacial. Se enfoca en optimizar el muestreo para obtener estimaciones precisas y confiables, cruciales para la planificaciÃ³n de estrategias de manejo de malezas ([Ambrosio et al., 2004](zotero://select/library/items/6U8TVNV2)).

In those instances, random methods were best, especially those imposing a minimal distance between samples.  ([1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/I25AL7BR?page=1&annotation=699U6IMS))

> ðŸŸ¨ **Amarillo**::  A typical protocol for sampling weeds for research purposes consists of selecting a given number of quadrats of a certain size, located on a grid, and counting the number of weeds of each species within each quadrat. The mean quadrat density for each weed species is then assumed to represent the Ã†eld.  ([2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/I25AL7BR?page=2&annotation=U7EQFB32))

However, weeds tend to cluster together in patches and they are not distributed randomly in the Ã†eld (Marshall, 1988; Van Groenendael, 1988; Thornton et al., 1990; Wiles et al., 1992; Johnson et al., 1995; 1996).

> ðŸŸ¨ **Amarillo**::  a sampling protocol may consist of dividing a Ã†eld into parts with a separate determination of the mean density within these parts. Such an approach may reduce variability in weed density estimates compared with a single estimate for an entire Ã†eld and a reduction in variability may improve the density estimate.
