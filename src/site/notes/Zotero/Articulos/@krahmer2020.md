> [!abstract]+ 
>Long-term national European weed surveys, large scale classical phytosociological programs and camera-based documentation systems lead to results which can be documented in form of maps. Comparisons of these visual representations of relative weed positions can be used for the prediction of changing weed spectra and of plant biodiversity changes. Statistical methods connected with mapping software are used for the analysis of environmental factors and of farm managing practices influencing the occurrence of weeds. Maps produced by sensor-driven weed detection devices still differ considerably from maps produced via classical phytosociological approaches. Computer algorithms may allow the precise identification of some weeds in camera images. The present technical solutions are, however, still far from those achieved by experienced botanists. Many weed detection tools based on algorithms are not able to distinguish between closely related weeds yet. A few European countries have a long tradition of surveying weeds in major crops by traditional tools. Various software packages are employed for the analysis, documentation and visualisation of survey results. Large scale comprehensive maps including the infestation of crops over different countries are, however, often biased as not every national research group uses the same methods for the assessment of weed infestation. The ranking of the most common species seems, however, to allow comparable conclusions. The recognition of trends in spectrum changes can only be derived from long term studies as we see it. Our review reflects discussions within the Weed Mapping Working Group of the European Weed Research Society over the last ten years. We try to identify new research trends and to respond accordingly with new research projects. What we see today is a shift from traditional mapping approaches towards the use of digital devices as for example in precision farming projects. Another issue of increasing importance is the mapping of herbicide resistant biotypes.

## Notes

@krahmer2020

gpt:: Este artículo revisa el estado del arte y las futuras tareas en el mapeo y encuestas de malezas en Europa. Se discuten diversas metodologías y tecnologías, proporcionando una visión comprensiva de los desafíos y oportunidades en el manejo de malezas ([Krähmer et al., 2020](zotero://select/library/items/RJC5SGRX)).
