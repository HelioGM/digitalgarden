>Weed control is necessary in rice cultivation, but the excessive use of herbicide treatments has led to serious agronomic and environmental problems. Suitable site-speciﬁc weed management (SSWM) is a solution to address this problem while maintaining the rice production quality and quantity. In the context of SSWM, an accurate weed distribution map is needed to provide decision support information for herbicide treatment. UAV remote sensing offers an efﬁcient and effective platform to monitor weeds thanks to its high spatial resolution. In this work, UAV imagery was captured in a rice ﬁeld located in South China. A semantic labeling approach was adopted to generate the weed distribution maps of the UAV imagery. An ImageNet pre-trained CNN with residual framework was adapted in a fully convolutional form, and transferred to our dataset by ﬁne-tuning. Atrous convolution was applied to extend the ﬁeld of view of convolutional ﬁlters; the performance of multi-scale processing was evaluated; and a fully connected conditional random ﬁeld (CRF) was applied after the CNN to further reﬁne the spatial details. Finally, our approach was compared with the pixel-based-SVM and the classical FCN-8s. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach achieved the best performance in terms of accuracy. Especially for the detection of small weed patches in the imagery, our approach signiﬁcantly outperformed other methods. The mean intersection over union (mean IU), overall accuracy, and Kappa coefﬁcient of our method were 0.7751, 0.9445, and 0.9128, respectively. The experiments showed that our approach has high potential in accurate weed mapping of UAV imagery.

## Notes

@huang2018a

gpt:: Se desarrolló un enfoque de etiquetado semántico para el mapeo preciso de malezas utilizando imágenes de alta resolución de UAV. Este método mejoró la precisión en la identificación y clasificación de malezas, apoyando la gestión específica de estas ([Huang et al., 2018](zotero://select/library/items/D7FGIMVG))
