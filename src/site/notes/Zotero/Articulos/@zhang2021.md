> [!abstract]+ 
>Precision agriculture relies on the rapid acquisition and analysis of agricultural information. An emerging method of agricultural monitoring is unmanned aerial vehicle low-altitude remote sensing (UAV-LARS), which possesses significant advantages of simple construction, strong mobility, and high spatial-temporal resolution with synchronously obtained image and spatial information. UAV-LARS could provide a high degree of overlap between X and Y during key crop growth periods that is currently lacking in satellite and remote sensing data. Simultaneously, UAV-LARS overcomes the limitations such as small scope of ground platform monitoring. Overall, UAV-LARS has demonstrated great potential as a tool for monitoring agriculture at fine- and regional-scales. Here, we systematically summarize the history and current application of UAV-LARS in Chinese agriculture. Specifically, we outline the technical characteristics and sensor payload of the available types of unmanned aerial vehicles and discuss their advantages and limitations. Finally, we provide suggestions for overcoming current limitations of UAV-LARS and directions for future work.
