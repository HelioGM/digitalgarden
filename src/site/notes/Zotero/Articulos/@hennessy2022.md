>Agricultural herbicide application efficiency can be improved using smart sprayers which provide site-specific, rather than broadcast, applications of agrochemicals. The YOLOv3-Tiny convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to detect two weeds, hair fescue and sheep sorrel, in images captured from wild blueberry fields throughout Nova Scotia, Canada. An evaluation was performed in three commercial wild blueberry fields in Nova Scotia to examine the effects of camera selection and target distance on detection accuracy. A Canon T6 DSLR camera, an LG G6 smartphone, and a Logitech c920 webcam were used to capture RGB images at varying distances from target weeds. Mean F1-scores for each combination of camera and image height were analysed in a 3 × 3 factorial arrangement for hair fescue and a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement for sheep sorrel. Images captured from 0.98 m with the LG G6 and Canon T6 produced F1-scores of up to 0.97 for detection of at least one hair fescue tuft. Images captured with the LG G6 and Canon T6 DSLR from 0.57 m achieved F1-scores of 0.94 and 0.93, respectively, for detection of at least one sheep sorrel plant per image. Sheep sorrel was undetectable in images from the Logitech c920 under 19 of 27 parameter combinations. Future work will involve using the CNN to control herbicide applications with a real-time smart sprayer. Additionally, the CNN will be used in a web-based application to detect target weeds and provide site-specific information to aid management decisions. Using a CNN to detect weeds will create improvements in management techniques, resulting in cost-savings and greater sustainability for the wild blueberry industry.
