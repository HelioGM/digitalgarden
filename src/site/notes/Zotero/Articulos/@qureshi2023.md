>The agricultural sector plays a crucial role in a nation’s GDP, and farmers use various pesticides to increase growth. However, labor costs are incurred by the application of pesticides, and remote sensing has made the process easierby supporting automation of this task. A major challenge while applying pesticides is weed mapping and detection, which is essential for weed control. Numerous studies have shown that deep learning based approaches, such asYOLO, Mask RCNN, and the cutting-edge vision transformer (ViT), give promising results in detecting weed problems, with better results on large and controlled datasets. However, there remains a gap in the early-stage weed detection.In this study, we address this gap by collecting images of an early-stage, uncontrolled environment using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and training our detection model on both CNN-based Mask RCNN and attention-based ViT. Our dataset is small and has complex features, with weeds of varying sizes and shapes. The CNN based architecture was not successful in using our data while the ViT outperformed it, achieving a mean average precision of 76% and an F1-score of 77%. Our study concludes that ViT can perform well on complex datasets and that large amounts of data are not necessary.
