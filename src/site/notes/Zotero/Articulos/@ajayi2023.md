>For sustainability and efficiency in maintaining high crop yield and less chemically polluted agricultural lands, precise weed mapping is essential for the total implementation of site-specific weed management which currently stands as a major challenge in present day agriculture. In this research, the robustness of the training epochs of You Only Look Once (YOLO) v5s, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was evaluated for the development of an automatic crop and weeds classification using UAV images. The images were annotated using a bounding box and they were trained on google colaboratory over 100, 300, 500, 600, 700 and 1000 epochs. The model detected and categorized five different classes which are sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum), banana trees (Musa), spinach (Spinacia oleracea), pepper (Capsicum), and weeds. To find the optimal performance on the test set, the model was trained across several epochs, and training was stopped when the test performance (classification accuracy, precision, and recall) began to drop. The obtained result shows that the performance of the classifier improved significantly as the range of training epochs tends to rise from 100 through to 600 epochs. Meanwhile, a slight decline was observed as the number of epoch was increased to 700 when the classification accuracy, the precision of weed and recall of 65, 43 and 43%, respectively, was recorded as against 67, 78 and 34% that was obtained as the classification accuracy, weed precision and recall, respectively, at 600 epochs. This decline continued even when the epoch was increased to 1000 where classification accuracy, weed precision and recall of 65%, 45% and 40%, respectively was obtained. The results showed that the training epoch of YOLOv5s significantly affects the model's robustness in automatic crop and weep classification and identified 600 as the epoch for optimal performance.
