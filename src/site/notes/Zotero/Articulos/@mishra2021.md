>Agriculture plays a vital role in societies and requires research, planning, and execution. It is important to research new trends, scientific methods, and boosters that can give a boost it. The farmer can reduce the amount of workload using some technology which is enhancing the quality of cereal. It is important to identify and growth estimation of weed using deep learning technology in the field of convolution neural networks. This review paper is identifying different types of weeds which are harmful to crop and also identify weed controlling mechanism. It is also useful for researchers to assimilate and clustered the weeds using artificial intelligence techniques and machine learning techniques and to study existing technology of weed detection, which is useful for a researcher can propose new techniques for weed classification and detection. This review paper concise the development of weed detection and classification using the most recent technologies in the field of artificial intelligence and image processing techniques. Concretely, the four procedures, i.e., pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification is a part of weed detection and classification were presented in detail. Sooner or later, demanding situations and answers furnished by researchers for weed class and detection inside the subject, together with occlusion and overlap of leaves, varying lighting conditions, and specific growth degrees, have been mentioned.
