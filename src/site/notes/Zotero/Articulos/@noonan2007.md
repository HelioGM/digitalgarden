> [!abstract]+ 
>This study showed that seasonal imagery acquired at specific stages of phenology can be used to improve the mapping accuracy of invasive willow at a catchment scale. SPOT5 XI (10 m) satellite imagery was acquired for early autumn and winter to represent the phenological stages of leaf cover and leaf fall respectively. Four classification regimes were evaluated using single- and bi-seasonal composite imagery to determine the most accurate method. Significant spectral noise was found in willow populations, especially in the winter image, due to the effects of undergrowth exposure, shadowing, topography and boundary-mixed pixels. Two noise reduction techniques were applied to the bi-seasonal composite image to improve the classification results. The noise-reduced bi-seasonal composite image was classified using the spectral angle mapper (SAM) algorithm before importation into a geographical information system. Aerial photography was used to reduce the errors of commission associated with misclassification of pastures. The class accuracy achieved for willow using the method described in this study was 77.5% (Kappa =0.87). The high cost of eradicating willow means that managers must establish priorities for control; this technique can provide a powerful tool for prioritizing control programmes and for monitoring results at a catchment scale.

## Notes

@noonan2007

gpt:: Este estudio presenta un método para mapear la distribución de sauces a escala de cuenca utilizando imágenes SPOT5 bisezonales. Se discuten las técnicas de análisis de imágenes y su aplicabilidad en la gestión de especies invasoras en ecosistemas acuáticos ([Noonan y Chafer, 2007](zotero://select/library/items/TLUUAGUR)).
