> [!abstract]+ 
>The objective of this study was to compare the efﬁciency of two methodologies, seed germination (SG) and seed physical extraction SPE), to assess the weed community from two locations with different soil and climatic conditions: M, with dry and low soil fertility, and S with high soil humidity and fertility. Over three years of study, the analysis of both methodologies conﬁrmed differences in seed bank composition. In M, fewer seeds were recorded by SG than SPE (13.5% and 86.5% respectively), while in S, the difference between percentages was less (31.58% by SG and 68.41% by SPE). Our ﬁndings conﬁrmed that Portulaca oleracea L., Amaranthus blitoides S. Watson and Chenopodium album L. were abundantly found in M. Anacyclus clavatus (Def.) Res. seeds were also found, mainly detected by SG. In S, Stellaria media (L.) Vill. was widely found. All species found in S were similarly detected by SG and SPE. The results conﬁrmed that climatic and soil conditions inﬂuenced the efﬁciency of the methodology used to assess the seed bank. M conditions led to an increased seed reservoir, and both methodologies were necessary to obtain the seed bank composition. In S conditions, the seed bank was continuously renewed, and either one of methodologies deﬁned the seed bank composition equally well.
