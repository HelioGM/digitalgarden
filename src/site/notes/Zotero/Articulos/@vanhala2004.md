> [!abstract]+ 
>A prerequisite for good research is the use of appropriate methodology. In order to aggregate sound research methodology, this paper presents some tentative guidelines for physical weed control research in general, and flame weeding, weed harrowing and intra-row cultivation in particular. Issues include the adjustment and use of mechanical weeders and other equipment, the recording of impact factors that affect weeding performance, methods to assess effectiveness, the layout of treatment plots, and the conceptual models underlying the experimental designs (e.g. factorial comparison, dose response).

## Notes

@vanhala2004

gpt:: Este documento ofrece directrices para la investigaciÃ³n en control fÃ­sico de malezas, incluyendo el deshierbe con llama, el escardado y la cultivaciÃ³n entre hileras. Se presentan metodologÃ­as y prÃ¡cticas recomendadas para evaluar y mejorar estas tÃ©cnicas de control no quÃ­mico de malezas ([Vanhala et al., 2004](zotero://select/library/items/P9J6HAR5)).

> ðŸŸ§ **Naranja**::  Assessments can be either done using quantitative methods (weed counts, weed biomass, weed seed production etc.) or qualitative methods (e.g. visual estimation of weed control). Where there are only a few dominant species, a count of the number of weeds in a given area may be possible. With many different species, an overall count will not take account of different sizes of plant, so that a total weed biomass may be more appropriate ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WHI9QN26?page=5&annotation=5Y3IH83Z))

> ðŸŸ§ **Naranja**::  For example, the visual evaluations might be done early during the season while the crop and weed densities might be determined later at the end of the growing season or prior to crop harvest. ([5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WHI9QN26?page=5&annotation=3YWZGYXH))

> [!naranja] Â 
> ðŸŸ§ **Naranja**::  Quantitative measures are ideal since they give actually measured values of weed density or biomass at a given point in time. However, the cost in resources and time is often prohibitive and this is why experimenter will resort to qualitative measures such as visual evaluations to assess the effect of weed control treatments on weeds and on crops.

> ðŸŸ§ **Naranja**::  Whilst visual scores can be quicker and easier to collect, they will usually have the disadvantage of being less easy to analyse. ([6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WHI9QN26?page=6&annotation=MHZMM5PG))

> ðŸŸ§ **Naranja**::  They will also rarely provide strong discrimination between treatments. Hence the choice of qualitative or quantitative measurements is the balance between the time and resources needed to make the assessment, and the ability to discriminate between treatments.

> ðŸŸ§ **Naranja**::  Visual assessments of the effect of weed control treatments on weeds can be used to complement weed counts or weed biomass sampling, or instead of these samplings. Visual observations can be taken very rapidly and more frequently than quantitative measures. In order to be reliable, these observations must be taken using a rating system that is clearly defined and simple. ([6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WHI9QN26?page=6&annotation=NS9EXRG6))

> ðŸŸ§ **Naranja**::  The most widely spread scale uses a 0 to 100 rating which is then used directly as percentages in analyses of variance (e.g. Table 1). The data might have to be transformed using the angular transformation (arcsin) in order to be normalized. However, if the scale is fairly crude (e.g. as percentage cover to the nearest 20%), data rarely satisfy the assumptions of analysis of variance (or other analysis methods), and will rarely discriminate between treatments.

If it is purely a visual score then it may not have the appropriate properties for this transformation, particularly as the precision associated with particular scores will probably vary in an odd way with the mean score.

> [!naranja] Â 
> ðŸŸ§ **Naranja**::  There is also an issue with visually comparing treatments with the weedy or weedfree check plots. This is fine if all plots have the same initial weed density and composition, but in practise this is rarely the case. It is almost always better to take pre-treatment assessments and consider the post-treatment differences allowing for the pre-treatment variation. This again indicates the value of using a truly quantitative assessment, as using a pre-treatment score as a covariate will often have insufficient precision to discriminate between different levels of response.
