> [!abstract]+ 
>Crop and weed discrimination in natural field environments is still challenging for implementing automatic agricultural practices, such as weed control. Some weed control methods have been proposed. However, these methods are still restricted as they are implemented under controlled conditions. The development of a sound weed control system begins by recognizing the crop and the different weed plants presented in the field. In this work, a classification approach of Zea mays L. (Crop), narrow-leaf weeds (NLW), and broadleaf weeds (BLW) from multi-plant images are presented. Moreover, a large image dataset was generated. Images were captured in natural field conditions, in different locations, and growing stages of the plants. The extraction of regions of interest (ROI) is carried out employing connected component analysis (CCA), whereas the classification of ROIs is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and compared with a shallow learning approach. To measure the classification performance of both methods, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics were used. The best alternative for the weed classification task at early stages of growth and in natural corn field environments was the CNN-based approach, as indicated by the 97% accuracy value obtained.
