> [!abstract]+ 
>Terrestrial vegetation has numerous positive effects on the main regulating services of agricultural channels, such as seed retention, pollutant mitigation, bank stabilization, and sedimentation, and this vegetation acts as a porous medium for the flow of matter through the channels. This vegetation also limits the water conveyance in channels, and consequently is frequently removed by farmers to increase its porosity. However, the temporal effects of these management practices remain poorly understood. Indeed, the vegetation porosity exhibits important temporal variations according to the maintenance schedule, and the water level also varies with time inside a given channel section according to rainfall events or irrigation practices. To maximise the impacts of vegetation on agricultural channels, it is now of primary importance to measure vegetation porosity according to water level over a long time period rather than at a particular time. Time series of such complex vegetation characteristics have never been studied using remote sensing methods. Here, we present a new approach using the Structure-from-Motion approach using a Multi-View Stereo algorithm (SfM-MVS) technique to construct time series of herbaceous vegetation porosity in a real agricultural channel managed by five different practices: control, dredging, mowing, burning, and chemical weeding. We post-processed the time series of point clouds to create an indicator of vegetation porosity for the whole section and of the surface of the channel. Mowing and chemical weeding are the practices presenting the most favorable temporal evolutions of the porosity indicators regarding flow events. Burning did not succeed in restoring the porosity of the channel due to quick recovery of the vegetation and dephasing of the maintenance calendar with the flow events. The high robustness of the technique and the automatization of the SfM-MVS calculation together with the post-processing of the point clouds should help in handling time series of SfM-MVS data for applications in ecohydrology or agroecology.

## Notes

@vinatier2018

gpt:: Se utilizó la fotogrametría para construir series temporales de la permeabilidad de la vegetación al agua y el transporte de semillas en vías acuáticas agrícolas. Aunque centrado en la gestión del agua, el estudio tiene implicaciones para el manejo de malezas en sistemas agrícolas ([Vinatier et al., 2018](zotero://select/library/items/34BBBUKP)).
